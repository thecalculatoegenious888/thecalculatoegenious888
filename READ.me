- 👋 Hello, I am @thecalculatoegenious888. I have been programming since I was around 5 years old, however I did my first and most likely only line of code at the time, when I was four and a half.
- 👀 Iam interested in software developing, programming, electrical engineering. I love Neil Tysons novels on Astronomy, as it is also a topic that fascinates me. I am heavily interested, experienced and talented in all fields of science, besides biology, which I 
find quite boring to be honest. However, I can assure to you, I am a sciecne lover, one of, it not the greatest one out their. It is my life, what I live for, and I will happily die for scientific research.
- 🌱 I am currently learning javaScrpit and phython currently. However I have been learning C++ for a few months now, I am still a beginner to it though.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on a artifical intelliegence program with someone. I want to develop a program that is designed for people to vent and, the artificial intelligence serving as a friend, who is there for their human user.
I want the artifical intelligence to be programmed and as advance as GP3 artifical intelligence, however I want it to respond differently to certain commands, meaning the artifical intelligence will have one purpose only, which
the main function will be to help others with mental struggles, which, I would love to collaborate with a team of professional programmers who can help me with this project, however for now, it is just an idea.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me at: thecalculatorgenious888@outlook.com.
